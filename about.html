	<h1><em>about me</em></h1>
	
	<h2> Hey! My name is Marissa,</h2>

	<p>Iâ€™m a sophomore in L&S at the University of Wisconsin-Madison hoping to study marketing and pursue certificates in both digital studies and leadership. </p>

	<p>I am interested in learning more about the customer experience and how to keep elevating the brand to suit the needs of our audience through digital media. I hope to  become a successful digital marketing manager in the makeup, wellness, fitness or fashion industry one day and believe that the skills I am learning now in school will allow me to achieve this.</p>

	<p>I am excited to continue learning and bring that knowledge into my current internship at a company called IL MAKIAGE and for everywhere else that I end up. </p>
